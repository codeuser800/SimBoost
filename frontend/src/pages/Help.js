                    <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                    
                    <p id = "paragraph"> We strive to help you make the most profit from your stock and options trading endeavors by boosting the power of your simulations. However, it is risky to deploy models for your trading strategies with your assets without first testing which models are optimal for your needs. We provide multiple, customizable models to predict stock and options prices for various companies in the S&P500. Feel free to experiment to see what sorts of parameters make the most optimal predictions for companies you might be interested in trading over. We make predictions over historical stock data so you can see how accurate our modelâ€™s predictions were in comparison to the true data of the time.  </p>
